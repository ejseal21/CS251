Example feature vector - 63,1,3,145,233,1,0,150,0,2.3,0,0,1,1
This is the first feature vector in the dataset


Precision of data - the data are precise to whole numbers except for oldpeak, which is precise to one decimal place.


There is a plot of the data for each feature, but they are only histograms, so it does not provide any information about relationships among features.
